# About

I have used IndeliJ to set up these templates.

The template assumes that you have gdx installed on your device.

Note that for other IDE's you might need something different. For that please refer to their main [website](https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/setup).

`NOTE`: The template's run configuration might need to be reconfigured to be alligned to the path, now I have made a configuration avalable for my device, for you it might be different.
